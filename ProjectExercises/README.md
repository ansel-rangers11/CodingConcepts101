# Project Exercises
In this folder, you can find a list of projects that I have found to be effective in tutoring certain coding concepts. They vary in difficulty and can be re-purposed based on the skill and speed of the student. Note that all projects listed here are aimed for high school level students or those that are new to coding. 


## Current Examples
* Digipet Project
* Website Building Project
