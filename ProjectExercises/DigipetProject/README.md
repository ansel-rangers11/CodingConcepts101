# Digipet Project
This project is about building a Digipet that can be interacted with and taken care of. The pet can be fed, attacked, interacted with, and many more. 

This project engages the student to explore how the front-end can interact with the back-end. The repo is set up such that constructors and boilerplate code are provided. The student will explore how to write class functions for added functionality, HTML components creation and interactivity, and handling console outputs.

- Add a button and back-end logic to attack and injure the pet
